# üåê AWS Frontend - Static Website Hosted on S3

This is the **frontend layer** of my AWS 2-tier cloud application project.  
It‚Äôs a simple static website hosted on **Amazon S3** that interacts with a Flask backend running on **Amazon EC2**.  

The goal of this part was to understand how a frontend hosted on S3 can securely communicate with a backend API on EC2 using HTTP requests.
